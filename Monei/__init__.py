MONEI API v1

The MONEI API is organized around REST principles. Our API is designed to be intuitive and developer-friendly.  ### Base URL  All API requests should be made to:  ``` https://api.monei.com/v1 ```  ### Environment  MONEI provides two environments:  - **Test Environment**: For development and testing without processing real payments - **Live Environment**: For processing real transactions in production  ### Client Libraries  We provide official SDKs to simplify integration:  - [PHP SDK](https://github.com/MONEI/monei-php-sdk) - [Python SDK](https://github.com/MONEI/monei-python-sdk) - [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/MONEI/monei-node-sdk) - [Postman Collection](https://postman.monei.com/)  Our SDKs handle authentication, error handling, and request formatting automatically.  You can download the OpenAPI specification from the https://js.monei.com/api/v1/openapi.json and generate your own client library using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).  ### Important Requirements  - All API requests must be made over HTTPS - If you are not using our official SDKs, you **must provide a valid `User-Agent` header** with each request - Requests without proper authentication will return a `401 Unauthorized` error  ### Error Handling  The API returns consistent error codes and messages to help you troubleshoot issues. Each response includes a `statusCode` attribute indicating the outcome of your request.  ### Rate Limits  The API implements rate limiting to ensure stability. If you exceed the limits, requests will return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.   # noqa: E501
